**Status:** Production Phase • **Architecture:** Fractal switchboard (MOS) with 6-layer contract stack

Domicile eliminates the prompt era. Contracts > Prompts. The system learns while you sleep.

## 🚀 Start Here

**New to Domicile?** Read these in order:
1. **[VISION.md](./VISION.md)** - What Domicile is and why it exists
2. **[QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)** - Get running in 5 minutes
3. **[SESSION_START.md](./SESSION_START.md)** - Agent session template
4. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Full technical architecture

## 🧠 Core Concept

Domicile is the platform where:
- **Humans contribute:** Architecture, contracts, governance rules
- **AI contributes:** Execution within contracts, learning from outcomes
- **System ensures:** Neither party fails the other

### The Problem with Prompts
1. Humans can't perfectly articulate intent in natural language
2. LLMs over-interpret or misinterpret instructions
3. **Neither party can trust the outcome**

### The Domicile Solution
Every interaction is a **contract** (typed Zod schema), not a prompt. The **policy engine** governs execution. The **Circadian loop** learns overnight from decisions vs. outcomes.

## ⚙️ Quick Start

```bash
cd ~/domicile_live
pnpm install                  # install workspaces
pnpm build                    # compile every package
pnpm test                     # run Vitest
```

### Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` and configure:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

Required variables documented in `.env.example`.

### MCP Server

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Start the MCP server
pnpm run mcp:start -w @domicile/interface

# In another terminal, run demos
pnpm run demo:real-estate
```

## 🔐 Why Contracts > Prompts

| Traditional Prompting | Domicile |
| --- | --- |
| Fragile text instructions | Typed contracts validated with Zod |
| Agent self-preference | Covenant trust scores + policy barriers |
| Manual auditing | Ledger + observability dashboard |
| Static systems | Circadian loop proposes improvements off-hours |

## 🧩 Foundation Highlights

- **Circadian Loop:** Day = human + AI collaboration. Night = dream about decisions vs. outcomes. Dawn = new mutual understanding.
- **Governance:** Circuit breakers, quarantine modes, and rollback ledgers ensure agents cannot skip the policy gate.
- **Memory:** Pinecone-backed knowledge graph, trainpack builder, and ROI vectors keep monetization loops contextual.
- **Observability:** Monitoring dashboard streaming SSE health data at `http://localhost:3001`.

## 🏛️ Master Orchestration System (MOS)

The autonomous engine is **deployed and running** on Supabase:
- **Production URL:** `https://rnarigclezfhlzrqueiq.supabase.co`
- **Architecture:** Fractal switchboard routing requests across products (DispoAI, CA-CAO, TARS)
- **Learning:** Dream cycles review executions vs. outcomes at 3 AM
- **Governance:** Constitutional router validates all requests

See `AUTONOMOUS_ENGINE_MAP.md` for integration details.

```bash
pnpm build                              # build all workspaces
pnpm run mcp:start -w @domicile/interface   # start MCP server
pnpm run demo:real-estate                   # run documented demo
CI=1 pnpm test                              # CI-friendly vitest run
```

## 🌅 Vision

Domicile is the collaboration surface where:
- Software understands what you mean the first time because contracts encode it
- Every failed attempt becomes a training signal the system reflects on overnight
- Agents evolve safely because Covenant refuses to ship anything with resilience score < 80

**It's not just another SDK—it's a governed ecosystem that learns while you sleep.**
