## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
- Git
- OpenAI API key (for testing)

### Development Setup
```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/contract-ai-platform.git
cd contract-ai-platform

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Build the project
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Choose an Issue
- Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/your-org/contract-ai-platform/issues) for open tasks
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Or for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/issue-number-description
```

### 3. Make Changes
- Follow the [coding standards](#coding-standards)
- Write tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass

### 4. Commit Changes
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Commit with conventional format
git commit -m "feat: add new agent capability

- Add capability declaration interface
- Implement validation logic
- Add comprehensive tests
- Update documentation"
```

### 5. Push and Create PR
```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
```

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Style
- 2-space indentation
- Semicolons required
- Single quotes for strings
- Trailing commas in multi-line structures

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Aim for >80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases

### Commit Messages
Follow conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

## Architecture Guidelines

### Contract Design
- Contracts must be machine-readable and validated
- Include comprehensive governance rules
- Define clear success criteria
- Support dependency management

### Agent Development
- Implement the `DomainAgent` interface
- Declare capabilities accurately
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful confidence scores

### Policy Engine
- Policies should be clear and enforceable
- Include severity levels for violations
- Support audit logging
- Allow for policy evolution

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { PolicyEngine } from '../src/policy-engine';

describe('PolicyEngine', () => {
  it('should approve valid contracts', () => {
    const engine = new PolicyEngine();
    const result = engine.evaluateContract(validContract);
    expect(result.approved).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end contract orchestration
- Verify agent interactions
- Test policy enforcement
- Validate audit logging

### Performance Tests
- Measure response times
- Test concurrent contract processing
- Monitor resource usage
- Validate scalability

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments to public functions
- Document complex algorithms
- Explain design decisions
- Provide usage examples

### User Documentation
- Update guides for new features
- Add examples and tutorials
- Maintain API reference documentation
- Keep architecture docs current

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code follows style guidelines

### Review Process
1. Automated checks run (tests, linting, type checking)
2. Code review by maintainers
3. Discussion and feedback
4. Approval and merge
5. Branch cleanup
